# Ada-Ravenscar-Embedded-Project-Micro:BitV2-RARTS
This project, baptized as Rage Against the Real-Time System, is an Ada Ravenscar hard real-time system for use in the course Intelligent Real-Time Systems at USN Kongsberg. In the project, the creators built a mecanum car, mounted ultrasonic sensors on it, then used a Micro:BitV2 as its controller. A second Micro:Bit can also be used as a remote control via radio link. 

The project consists of two independent GNAT Studio projects with different source code; "Mecanum Car" contains the source code that is to run on a micro:bit mounted on the actual mecanum-car, while "Remote Microbit" contains the code that is to run on a separate remote control micro:bit.

The creators are: Stian Nordholm and Anders MÃ¸rk Minde
